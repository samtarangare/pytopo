<h1>PyTopo: Setting Up Your .pytopo File</h1>

<p>
In order to use pytopo, you need to create a file called
<b>.pytopo</b> in your home directory to tell pytopo
where you keep your maps and what format they're in.
There are also some other variables you can customize
in that file.

<h2>Collections</h2>
<p>
A <i>Collection</i> is a set of maps from one source, all
in the same format. For instance, if I load the Topo! Death
Valley CD into a directory, that would represent one collection.
<p>
You must have at least one collection in order to use pytopo
(otherwise it won't know where to look for your map data).
<p>
Define your collections like this:
<pre>
Collections = [
    Topo1MapCollection( "deathvalley", "/home/yourname/Maps/dvl_data",
                        7.5, 266, 328 ),
    Topo2MapCollection( "kingscyn", "/home/yourname/Maps/kingscyn", "topo",
                        410, 256 ),
    GenericMapCollection( "pa-geo", "/home/yourname/Maps/pa-geo-300",
                          "pa-geo-300-", ".jpg",
                          -122.497, 37.498, 300, 400, 10746, 13124,
                          2, True, False )
]
</pre>
This defines three collections. The first one is called "deathvalley",
stored in the directory named <i>/home/yourname/Maps/dvl_data</i>,
and uses the format <i>Topo1MapCollection</i> -- the simple format used
in Topo! regional CD sets. The filenames already have latitude
and longitude encoded into them, but you do need to specify the size.
<p>
The second collection is a different sort of Topo! format, one
with filenames beginning with "topo" and much wider and shorter jpeg
images.
<p>
The third collection, called "pa-geo" and stored
in <i>/home/yourname/Maps/pa-geo</i>, is more complicated.
<i>GenericMapCollection</i> is a much more general format
suitable for map collections you create yourself.
Suppose a sample map in the collection might have a filename
like <b>pa-map-03-17.png</b>. Then the pieces of the
GenericMapCollection are:
<p>
<p>
<table>
<tr><th align=left>Field <th align=left>Value <th align=left>Description
<tr><td>Name <td>pa-geo <td>Name of the collection
<tr><td>Directory <td>/home/yourname/Maps/pa-geo <td>Directory where
the files live
<tr><td>Prefix <td>pa-map- <td>Prefix prepended to every filename
<tr><td>Suffix <td>.png <td>Suffix (extension) appended to every filename
<tr><td>Longitude <td>123 <td>Longitude of upper left corner
<tr><td>Latitude <td>37.5 <td>Latitude of upper left corner
<tr><td>Width <td>Width of each maplet
<tr><td>Height <td>Height of each maplet
<tr><td>X scale <td>10742 <td>X scale (pixels per degree)
<tr><td>Y scale <td>13120 <td>Y scale (pixels per degree)
<tr><td>Num digits <td>2 <td>Number of digits for each grid point in
the filenames
<tr><td>Use dash? <td>True <td>Use a dash between X and Y grid point
numbers in the file name? (E.g. pa-map-03-17.png vs. pa-map-0317.png.)
<tr><td>Latitude first? <td>True <td>Is the latitude the first grid
point (e.g. 03) in the filename?
</table>
<p>
Map Collections are simply Python classes. If you have a weird type
of map collection and you know some Python programming, you can define
your own map collection type inside your .pytopo file. If you write
a collection class that might be useful to someone else, please send
it to me and I'll include it in the next version of pytopo.
<p>
I'm working on a new format, using tiles downloaded from the
<a href="http://openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a> project.
Stay tuned for PyTopo 0.9!

<h2>Named Sites</h2>
<p>
Once you have one or more collections defined, you can start
defining named sites which you can use as starting points
when you run pytopo.
<p>
The format is:
<pre>
[ sitename, longitude, latitude, collection_name ]
</pre>
Coordinates are in degrees.decimal_minutes.
<p>
Example:
<pre>
 KnownSites = [
     # San Francisco Bay Area
     [ "saratogagap", 122.0725, 37.155, "sfr" ],
     [ "lexington", 121.594, 37.12, "sfr" ],
     # Death Valley
     [ "zabriskie", 116.475, 36.245, "deathvalley" ],
     # From the Big Sur map:
     [ "pinnacles", 121.0865, 36.3247, "bigsur" ],
     ]
</pre>

<h2>Other Useful Variables</h2>
<p>
You can customize pytopo by changing the values of these variables:

<pre>
# Where to save generated maps. The default is fine for most people.
MapSaveDir = os.environ["HOME"] + "/Topo/"
<b>Note:</b> Saving maps may be buggy. I haven't tested it in
quite a long time.
</pre>

<p>
Adding more customizable variables to this file is another feature
coming in version 0.9.
