This is PyTopo, an application for exploring maps using local data.
See the project home page at http://shallowsky.com/software/topo
for more information.

==================================
PyTopo quick start guide:

To run pytopo, you need some local map data.

Eventually PyTopo will be able to download map data from openstreetmap,
but until that happens, you need to get it one of these ways:

- Take a large map (a raster image, PDF, etc.) and split it into
  small tiles (using something like the "mapsplit" script, provided here)
  then figure out appropriate coordinates for the top left;

- Download OpenStreetMap tiles using a program such as TangoGPS;

- Use commercial Topo! regional map sets, e.g. "San Francisco Bay Area"

Since that can be tricky, you can use some sample tiles, provided here,
which were downloaded from OpenStreetMap.

If you have this source in ~/src/pytopo, then do the following:

mkdir ~/Maps
ln -s ~/src/pytopo/data/opencyclemap ~/Maps/
mkdir ~/.config/pytopo
cp ~/src/pytopo/sample.pytopo ~/.config/pytopo
  (If you prefer, you can put .pytopo directly in your home directory.)

IMPORTANT: You must edit ~/.config/pytopo and change "user" to your
login name.

That will give you an entry called "cimatest" pointing to the
opencyclemap data for Cima Dome, in the Mojave desert.

pytopo cimatest
should run pytopo starting at that location.

Arrow keys navigate you around. See the home page for more information
on things you can do and how to create more map data.

More documentation coming soon.
