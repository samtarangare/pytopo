PyTopo is a collection of Python programs for viewing, exploring and integrating local map data of various sorts, including tiled topographic maps, GPS track logs and others.

PyTopo is primarily intended for offline map viewing, so you can view maps while you're traveling and away from network access.

The collection also includes scripts for visualizing other map-related information, such as elevation profiles from a GPS track log.
