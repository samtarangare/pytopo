<h1>Ellie: plot elevation from a GPS track</h1>

<p>
There are lots of ways, mostly related to the <a
href="http://openstreetmap.org">Open Street Map</a> project,
to display GPS data on Linux. But none of them display elevation.
I like being able to track how much I climbed on a hike or bike
ride.
<p>
So I wrote a little Python script which I'm calling ellie.
It parses track log files, in gpx format, and gives you a graph
and a few statistics.
<p>
It uses pylab for plotting, which uses matplotlib; you'll need
the python-matplotlib package installed (or its equivalent).

<h2>Download</h2>
<p>
Get it here: <a href="ellie-0.2">ellie v. 0.2</a>.

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>
<code>ellie tracklog.gpx</code>
It can currently plot only one track log at a time (is there
much need to do more?)
