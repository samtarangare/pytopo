<h1>pytopo: Topographic Maps for Linux</h1>

<p>
<b>PyTopo</b> is a Python-gtk script which interprets
local tiled map data (for instance, from a <i>Topo!</i> data CD),
and displays it in an interactive viewer, where you can scroll
to adjacent maps, switch between resolutions, or produce a map
image for printing or editing.
<p>
<b>Why does PyTopo exist?</b>
There were several existing Linux mapping applications which take data
from online web sites or roads databases, and others which take GPS
data and correlate it with online maps.
But I typically need maps when I'm travelling and don't have
net access!
I couldn't find any apps that would display data for any location,
without requiring a GPS, using local map sources with no net connection
needed.
(There are a few possibilities but nothing that really solves the problem:
GPSdrive claims it can do local mapping now, 
but I've tried three versions with no luck getting it to run at all.
And there's a neat little
program called TangoGPS that can download and show OSM maps, but it has a
difficult interface that's optimized for cellphones.)

<p>
<b>Download: The current version is <a href="pytopo-0.8">PyTopo 0.8</a>.</b>

<p>
0.8 had lots of changes -- including changes, I'm sorry to say,
to the configuration file where you define your collections.
I wrote up some <a href="releasenotes-0.8">Release notes for 0.8</a>
and have updated the <a href="fileformat.html">Pytopo file formats</a>
page to reflect the new syntax.

<p>
Or get the current SVN version:
<b><a href="http://code.google.com/p/pytopo/">PyTopo is hosted
on Google Code</a></b>.

<h2>Using PyTopo</h2>
<p>
<b>Begin</b> by creating a file named <i>.pytopo</i> in your home directory,
in which you define a list of named coordinates, and specify some other
parameters such as location of the map data and preferred window size.
Read the comments at the beginning of the <i>pytopo</i> script for
samples of the .pytopo file.

<h3>Key bindings</h3>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Left, Right,<br>Up, Down
<td>Scroll the map in the indicated direction.
<tr>
<th>+/=, -
<td>Zoom in to the 7.5 minute series, or out to the 15 minute series.
(Zooming isn't supported in other map formats yet.)
<tr>
<th>s
<td>Save the current map to a file under <i>$HOME/Topo</i>
<tr>
<th>Space
<td>Print (to standard output) the current coordinates of map center.
</table>

<p>
<b>Clicking</b> in the map displays the coordinates of where you
clicked, as well as the distance and bearing from the last clicked
point.

<h3>Usage (commandline arguments)</h3>
<pre>
Usage: pytopo [-t trackfile] site_name
       pytopo [-t trackfile] start_lat start_long collection
       pytopo -p
Use degrees.decimal_minutes format for coordinates.
Set up site names in ~/.pytopo
Print list of known sites with pytopo -p

Track files may contain track points and/or waypoints;
multiple track files are allowed.
</pre>

<h2>Bugs/Wishlist</h2>
<p>
I'm working on a new OSMMapCollection format that uses tiles
downloaded from OpenStreetMap.org (for instance, by TangoGPS);
this code is included in PyTopo 0.8 but is not yet stable nor
documented, so if you use it you'll certainly see some bugs.
I didn't want to hold 0.8 just for that, so expect better OSM support
in PyTopo 0.9.
<p>
Track logs (a new feature in 0.8) are also not fully working: they
may be off by a bit, if the coordinate system ("datum") your GPS
is using differs from the datum of your maps (which is likely,
especially with Topo!) data. I'm working on fixing that properly --
darnit, that may require yet another format change since
MapCollections may need to specify that -- but the fix probably
won't come until 0.9.

<h2>Getting Map Data</h2>
<p>
PyTopo assumes that you already have maps locally, on disk or CD,
in a supported image format,
named according to the <i>Topo!</i> naming conventions.
(PyTopo 0.5 adds support for other naming conventions as well.)
<p>
The <i>Topo!</i> local area and specific park map packages
sold in camping/hiking stores
(sometimes under the aegis of National Geographic) are
reasonably priced as a source of map data.
They come with Windows software, but Linux users can ignore
the software and use the data files, which are
standard GIF, named in a fairly straightforward way.
They're a good source of US map data.
<p>
<b>Caution: the <i>Topo! Back Roads Explorer</i> and the statewide
explorer collections are <i>not</i> in this friendly format.</b>
They use large data files
in a proprietary ".tpq" format.
<a href="http://cholla.mmto.org/computers/topomaps/">Tom Trebisky
has analyzed the format and has written an extractor</a>,
and he also has <a href="http://cholla.mmto.org/gtopo/">a C GTK
viewer</a> for this format. (Eventually I hope to integrate
direct support for them into pytopo as well.)
<p>
Just to be clear: I am not distributing map data.

<h3>Making Your Own Map Collections</h3>
<p>
You can buy map bits directly from the USGS, but they have
a hefty setup fee so it's not cost effective unless you're buying
quite a lot.
<p>
For some areas, you can download topo maps; for instance,
for California you can get maps in TIFF format from the
<a href="http://casil.ucdavis.edu/casil/gis.ca.gov/drg/">California
Spatial Information Library</a>. You still have to split up the
maps into maplets, though; if you have ImageMagick, you can use
a command like
<pre wrap>
convert in-map.jpg -rotate 90 -crop 300x300 -repage +0+0 out-map%02d.jpg
</pre>
<p>
Note: previously I included <i>-trim</i> as part of that line, and
a lot of pages you'll find googling for image splitting will tell you
to use -trim. Don't: it will give you maps of inconsistent sizes,
and pytopo has no way to tell where the origin of the map should be.
<p>
A map split this way can be read with PyTopo 0.5 or later.
Maps downloaded as PDF (such as USGS geologic maps) might work
in imagemagick, but if not, try converting them
to a raster format before splitting, using a program like GIMP
or a command like
<pre wrap>
gs -sDEVICE=jpeg -r300 -sOutputFile=output-map.jpg input-map.pdf
</pre>

<h2>Non-interactive mapping scripts</h2>
<p>
I wrote some older commandline helper scripts, but honestly, I don't use them
myself and don't vouch for them. I list them here merely on the chance
that someone might find one of them a useful building block:
<p>
<ul>
<li><a href="topomap">topomap</a>, which takes start and end coordinates
and builds a custom map.  This is mostly replaced by the 's'
functionality in pytopo, but might be useful if you need to display
a map larger than you can display on your screen.
<li><a href="onetopo">onetopo</a>, which takes start coordinates and
combines the maplets into one complete USGS 7.5-minute map.
</ul>

<p>
<h2>Is it Only For Linux?</h2>
PyTopo should run fine on any system which has Python, gtk,
gdk-pixbuf, and PyGTK. If it doesn't work, please let me know.

<h2>Coming Soon</h2>
<i>(Stuff I want that should be easy to implement or is already
    in progress.)</i>
<ul>
<li>New Collection class for tiles downloaded from OpenStreetMap.
<li>Downloading its own tiles from OSM to save locally.
<li>Zoom farther out or in (i.e. scale the map images rather
    than always displaying them at 1:1).
<li>Drag scrolling, including diagonal scrolling, rather than
    moving only with arrow keys by multiples of a whole maplet.
</ul>

<h2>Wishlist</h2>
<i>(Stuff that would be nifty, but is either difficult,
or requires additional map data that I'd have to pay for.
If you want something on this list, bribing me with interesting
map data would be an excellent approach.)</i>
<ul>
<li>Draw maps from non-tiled openstreetmap vector data.
<li>Combine with elevation data to make pretty maps.
    (The limiting factor here is getting some elevation data and
    figuring out the format.)
<li>Flip back and forth between two sets of maps.
    (Limiting factor: getting other set of maps in digital format,
    e.g.  geologic maps or road maps.)
<li>Better control over projections and datum (PyTopo isn't smart
    about those at all).
</ul>
